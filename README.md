# Peer Routing Activity

Fork my intro mongoose repo: https://github.com/mhwalsh/intro-mongoose

Using the Express Routing documentation: http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

1. Create a routes folder with two new files, one for the 'millie' themed routes and another for general user routes. Require these routes in the main server file and make sure the server is functioning as it was before. Commit.
2. Again referring to the documentation, create three new general user routes that follow the requirements below. Remember to commit as you go. Maybe after each new route you create.
*Create a route gets a user by a specific user id and returns that users object. For example the URL should look like: http:localhost:3000/577509
*Create an update route that takes a specific user id and a body that contains the field to update. http:localhost:3000/update/577509 or http:localhost:3000/577509
*Create a delete route that takes a specific user id and deletes the user. http:localhost:3000/delete/577509 or http:localhost:3000/577509
Document your API i.e. your new routes. Make sure that it follows restful practices.

Remember you can test these with the REST CLIENT atom package, but you are welcome to add a UI to it.

Once finished submit the repo your partners name.
